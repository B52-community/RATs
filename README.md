# RATs
Remote Access Trojan

RATs are designed to hide themselves on infected machines, providing secret access to an attacker. They often accomplish this by piggybacking malicious functionality on a seemingly legitimate application. For example, a pirated video game or business application may be available for free because it has been modified to include malware.

The stealthiness of RATs can make them difficult to protect against. Some methods to detect and minimize the impact of RATs include:

Focus on Infection Vectors: RATs, like any malware, are only a danger if they are installed and executed on a target computer. Deploying anti-phishing and secure browsing solutions and regularly patching systems can reduce the risk of RATs by making it more difficult for them to infect a computer in the first place.
Look for Abnormal Behavior: RATs are trojans that commonly masquerade as legitimate applications and may be composed of malicious functionality added to a real application. Monitor applications for abnormal behavior, such as notepad.exe generating network traffic.
Monitor Network Traffic: RATs enable an attacker to remotely control an infected computer over the network, sending it commands and receiving the results. Look for anomalous network traffic that may be associated with these communications.
Implement Least Privilege: The principle of least privilege states that users, applications, systems, etc. should only have the access and permissions that they need to do their job. Implementing and enforcing least privilege can help to limit what an attacker can achieve using a RAT.
Deploy Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): RATs commonly attempt to steal usernames and passwords for online accounts. Deploying MFA can help to minimize the impact of credential compromises.
Prevent RAT Infections with Check Point
Protecting against RAT infections requires solutions that can identify and block malware before it gains access to an organizationâ€™s systems. Check Point Harmony Endpoint provides comprehensive protection against RATs by preventing common infection vectors, monitoring applications for suspicious behavior, and analyzing network traffic for signs of C2 communications.
